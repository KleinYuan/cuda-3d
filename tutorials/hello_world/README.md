# Hello World

This hellow world project contains basic practice codes from the NVIDIA course [Fundamentals of Accelerated Computing with CUDA C/C++](https://courses.nvidia.com/courses/course-v1:DLI+C-AC-01+V1/about). The purpose is to provide fundamental examples to introduce the basic concepts, archs, syntax, coordinating-parallel-threads, memory management and debug, with native CUDA.

The project is tested on a 2080ti GPU (sm_75):

- [X] [hello_world.cu](hello_world.cu)
- [X] [loop_accelerate.cu](loop_accelerate.cu)
- [X] [coordinating_parallel.cu](coordinating_parallel.cu)


How to run it? Check the Makefile.

```
make run-hello-world
>>nvcc -arch=sm_75 -o hello-world hello_world.cu -run
