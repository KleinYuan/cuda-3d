# Operators

Common operators used in 3D, starting from the most naive one:

Distances:

- [ ] Euclidean Distance between two points
- [ ] Average Euclidean Distance between two sets of points (same number), differentiable
- [ ] Chamfer Distance between two set of points (arbitrary number), differentiable
- [ ] Earth Mover Distance (EMD) from one set points to another, differentiable


Clustering:

- [ ] Euclidean Clustering
- [ ] Depth Clustering
