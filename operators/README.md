# Operators

Common operators used in 3D, starting from the most naive one:

Sampling:
- [X] [Uniform Sample](uniform_sample.cu)

Distances:

- [x] [Average Euclidean Distance between two sets of points (same number)](euclidean_distance.cu), differentiable
- [ ] Chamfer Distance between two set of points (arbitrary number), differentiable
- [ ] Earth Mover Distance (EMD) from one set points to another, differentiable


Clustering:

- [ ] Euclidean Clustering
- [ ] Depth Clustering
